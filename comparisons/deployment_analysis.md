# Deployment Complexity Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the deployment complexity of three different approaches to serving MobileNetV3-Large models in Kubernetes:

1. **Custom FastAPI System** - Your existing PyTorch-based FastAPI application
2. **KServe** - Using TorchServe format for PyTorch model serving
3. **TensorFlow Serving** - Using TensorFlow's native serving infrastructure

## Analysis Methodology

For each system, we evaluate:
- **Lines of YAML**: Total lines across all Kubernetes manifests
- **Number of Resources**: Count of Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.
- **Complexity Score**: 1-5 scale (1=simple, 5=complex)
- **Prerequisites**: Required tools, operators, and dependencies
- **Deployment Time**: Actual time from `kubectl apply` to ready state
- **Ease of Updates**: How easy it is to change model versions or configurations

## Conclusion

**KServe offers the lowest complexity** with minimal YAML configuration and automatic scaling, making it ideal for production deployments where you want to focus on model development rather than infrastructure.

**TensorFlow Serving provides good balance** between simplicity and control, especially for TensorFlow-based workflows.

**Custom FastAPI gives maximum control** but requires more configuration and maintenance, making it suitable for specialized use cases or when you need custom serving logic.

The choice depends on your specific requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintenance preferences.
